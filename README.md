# gssim
GelSight measurement simulations for algorithm development and verification

## Description and requirements

This project contains MATLAB code for generating simulated GelSight scans that can be loaded into GelSight commercial software, GelSight Mobile and GSCapture, for testing measurement routines. The functions can create scans with known heightmaps (Z), sets of simulated images, along with a scan.yaml file within a scan folder. The scan folder can be added to an active library and analyzed by GelSight software.

This software is written in MATLAB and assumes the gsmatlab package is in your MATLAB path.
